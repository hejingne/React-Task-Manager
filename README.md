## Introduction

A web application implemented in React.js in tandem with Hooks and ReactDOM that allows users to add, edit and delete any task they want to work on or mark any task as complete.\
Users can view specific subsets of tasks -- all tasks, only the active tasks or only the completed tasks by selecting the corresponding filtering keyword.\
All features are also accessible to keyboard and screen-reader users.
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
